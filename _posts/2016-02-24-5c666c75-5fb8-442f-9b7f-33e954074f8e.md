**What is it?**

Wild Teaching is a bespoke training course for teachers and carers. You will learn how to create outstanding outdoor learning experiences linked directly to the Curriculum for Excellence.

These practical courses will give you the confidence, resources and skills you need to take learning outdoors. From a small trough in the playground to the Pentland hills - we have adaptable lesson plans to suit any setting.

**Who is it for?**

Wild Teaching is for anyone who works in the
education of children and with the Curriculum for Excellence.

From toddlers to teenagers - our courses will
provide you with tried and tested activities to use with your class whatever
their age or ability. 

We will provide you with practical
information on health and safety and risk assessments for outdoor
learning.

You will return to your
setting armed with the information you need to ensure that you, your managers
and parents are confident that any risks have been identified and are managed
wisely.

This is not just another entry in your CPD
log -- you will leave the course buzzing with ideas and eager to put what you
have learned into practice.
